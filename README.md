venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
Install project dependencies (if any): pip install -r requirements.txt 


Setup (Flask)Install Flask:
pip install Flask
Navigate to your Flask API directory:cd Flask
Run the Flask development server:python app.py

Clone the repository
cd Django/OnlineCoursePlatform

If you don't have a repo, and have the files locally, navigate to the directory
Run migrations:python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser:python manage.py createsuperuser
Start the Django development server:python manage.py runserver
The Django backend will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/



Frontend Setup (HTML, CSS)Place your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a designated directory. This could be a folder named frontend, static, or templates within your Django project, or a separate directory.

Run the Django development server (as shown in the "Backend Setup" section).  
This will serve your HTML files (either as templates or as static files). 
Make sure your Flask server is also running to provide the API data.
Run migrations to create the database schema.
