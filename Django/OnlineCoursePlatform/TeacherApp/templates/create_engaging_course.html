    <h1 class="title">Create an Engaging Course</h1>
    <p class="description">
        It's important to make sure your course is engaging for your students with a well-structured, practical, and
        rewarding learning experience. The most successful instructors spend time planning their course content
        before they start recording to ensure their course helps students achieve clear goals.
    </p>
    <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">Step 1: Choose your course topic.</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            Pick something you're knowledgeable in and genuinely excited about teaching. Learn more about

        <h2 class="step-title">Step 2: Define your intended learners and your course’s learning objectives.</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            Before you begin creating content for your course, it’s important to determine who you are teaching and
            what your students will learn or be able to accomplish by the end of your course. Learn more about what
            questions to ask yourself about your learners and how to write clear learning objectives.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">Step 3: Decide how students will practice what you’re teaching.</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            students love being hands-on with their learning: they want to practice what they’ve learned through
            exercises, activities, case studies, and more! There are lots of different types of practice activities
            you can add to your course to help create an engaging online learning experience.

        <h2 class="step-title">Step 4: Create your course outline.</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            Your course outline is the foundation for your course--this is where you decide how you will structure
            and organize your course content. We have an outline template to help you get started!

    <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">Step 5: Script your course.</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            Once you know how your course will be structured, the next step is to prep for recording your lectures.
            Most instructors find that scripting each lecture (or writing bullet point notes) helps to reduce the
            amount of time spent recording and editing and increases the overall quality of their delivery.
