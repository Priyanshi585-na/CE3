    <p class="description">
        Once you have chosen your topic, created your course outline, and planned your content, it's important to start
        planning your video production. Don’t worry if you’ve never recorded an online course. We have resources for you

        <h2 class="step-title">Step 1: Determine the type of videos you’ll record:</h2>
        <p class="step-description">
            Once your course content is planned (you have validated your
            course topic and completed your
            course outline), it’s time to record. You can record yourself (talking head), record your screen
            (screencasting), or do a mix of both. The type of course you'll record will determine the equipment you'll
            need.
